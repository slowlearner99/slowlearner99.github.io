title: Why you shouldn’t buy GTA 5 and Skyrim for now
---

A lot of people buy a game, enjoy it for a while and then don’t particularly care about it anymore. A lot of games have very little replayability value; that is, there’s almost no point in playing it after you’ve finished the game once. Some games however have close to limitless replayability. How does this work? One word: Mods

A Mod (short for modification) is tool that changes some part of a video game. It could be a silly mod, like putting a hat and monocle on a crab or a mod that adds in hundreds of hours of content.

Most mods are created by the community of a video game and not the company that makes the game and because of this, are uploaded to the internet where anyone can download and modify their game for free. However, that may change soon.

In the recent E3 conference (Electronic Entertainment Expo), which is a conference where video game developers present their upcoming games to build up hype for them, Bethesda – the publisher of the widely acclaimed Elder Scrolls series, announced that they will have a ‘Creation Club’, where users can buy mods with credits, which aren’t likely to be free. This is essentially another attempt at paid mods by them, after their first attempt crashed and burned spectacularly.


And now, Take Two Interactive, the publisher for the Grand Theft Auto series has sent a cease and desist letter to the developers behind the OpenIV, the popular modding tool for GTA, claiming that OpenIV enables malicious mods that interfere with the online experience in GTA V. One of the developers of OpenIV responded with this post on GTAforums, where he claims that they do not mess with Online at all. However, despite disagreeing with the claims, they agreed to Take Two’s demands and stopped distribution of OpenIV because, “Going to court will take at least few months of our time and huge amount of efforts, and, at best, we'll get absolutely nothing”.


Modding in GTA and the Elder Scrolls series is what has kept the series alive for so long. Even though the normal game is fun by its own right, there’s no way that people would have invested the thousands of hours that they have into the game without mods to change up the game a little bit. This is even more of a problem with Bethesda, where the game they release is usually riddled with game-breaking bugs, which are usually fixed by modders in unofficial patches. In fact, with the move by Take Two, the recent reviews score on GTA V on Steam has gone down to “Overwhelmingly negative”.


So, until Bethesda and Take Two have a better method, the only thing we consumers can do is vote with our wallet – don’t buy their games. If enough people stop buying their games, the publishers will get the message and realize that the community is not happy with their decisions.
