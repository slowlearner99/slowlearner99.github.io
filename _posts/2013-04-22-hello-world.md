People moaning about spoilers online followed by fanboys outrage about “I can’t believe they did that to *insert character name here*”. If you’re like me you know what time of the year this is. Forgive the terrible pun for the title, but this blogpost is about something I deeply do not care about and it is….

GAME OF FUCKING THRONES.

I mean I get that you like the show but for the love of all that is holy get a fucking grip. The number one thing about being a fanboy is, you need to understand,

PEOPLE DO NOT NEED TO LIKE THE SAME THINGS YOU LIKE.

Being a avid fan of fiction, sci-fi , anime among others people just assume that I like the show, and when I do correct them, I get to watch blood slowly drain from their faces. Some look at me as if I just killed their dog (Shitty metaphor I haven’t killed a dog…. yet).

Some of my acquaintances just quit it here and just think of me as someone with no taste (which I admire) . Another set of morons ask me if I’ve read the books (I mean I do have a friend who’s read the books and can’t follow the show from the start cause it’s boring and not from the middle cause he’s lost, but he’s an idiot ( FUCK YOU JOE )), 

But the largest breed begins to recommend it as if it was a sacred mission given to them by George RR Martin himself. “It has dragons”  is the most popular phrase used to convince me. That is a much bigger turn off, Dragons are stupid. The only dragon that I found lovable and relatable is Toothless, Even the hobbit’s dragon wasn’t that appealing and It was voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch. When I continue to tell them I just do not like the show, the ask me what the real reason(?).

Yeah JIm I have Daddy issues that’s why I do not want to watch your dumb show. NEWSFLASH I watched the show, and  IT WAS TERRIBLE. Don’t agree with me?, Your choice not to.

Look all I’m saying is, there are plenty of us who do not follow the show, Just like any show it just doesn’t appeal to us. Please do not look at us like soul-less tasteless morons just because we do not like the same shit as you.

Peace out!
